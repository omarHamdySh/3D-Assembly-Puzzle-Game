  - heading: Omar Hamdy
    text: This is Omar Hamdy baby, welcome to my starter project free documented asset
      made by me. The starter project is just an empty basic project which is very
      important to me at the begining of a new project or even to add some basic functionality
      to an already existed one. The point is that there are some essintial scripts
      that you might need use at almost any and every game these scripts to handle
      time, management between classes, Different gameplay modes, states and much
      more. The package will be updated on github so keep track of it untill it reaches
      to be named SDK God willing. Hope to enjoy it.
